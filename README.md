# mnml-startpage
This is an MINIMAL startpage without any relation with the fashion brand MNML. I just remove all vowels from the word "minimal". Based on cadejscroggins's project, which is named "tilde", I modified it to meet my requirements and habit, including:
* Bookmarks
* Groups
* Shortcut-keys
* Re-draw brand logo with CSS background element (yes, i know it's crazy but funny!)
and (may be?) something which I forgot

# To-do lists:
Not sure, but may be:
* Search Engines and Suggestions?
* Multi-level of Bookmarks?
* New Commands?
I will update when I need!

# This a personal receipe!

## Tilde

Inspired by [/r/startpages](https://www.reddit.com/r/startpages)â€”the idea is to
have a homepage for your browser that is functional and sexy.

### Usage

To go to a site, enter the corresponding key. To view the available sites and
their keys, press `?`. If your input doesn't match any of the commands, a
generic Google search will be triggered. For example:

- Entering `r` would redirect you to [www.reddit.com](https://www.reddit.com).
- Entering `t` would redirect you to [twitch.tv](https://www.twitch.tv).
- Entering `cats` would search
  [Google for cats](https://encrypted.google.com/search?q=cats).

On mobile, you can click the clock to focus the search input.

#### Searching

You can search any of the sites by typing a colon after the site's key, followed
by your search query. For example:

- Entering `g:tilde` would search
  [GitHub for tilde](https://github.com/search?q=tilde).
- Entering `s:radiohead` would search
  [SoundCloud for radiohead](https://soundcloud.com/search?q=radiohead).

#### Specific Locations

You can go to a specific location on a site by typing a forward slash after the
site's key, followed by the location on the site you'd like to be redirected to.
For example:

- Entering `r/r/startpages` would redirect you to
  [www.reddit.com/r/startpages](https://www.reddit.com/r/startpages)
- Entering `h/popular` would redirect you to
  [hypem.com/popular](http://hypem.com/popular).

#### URL Redirects

If you enter in a full domain or URL, you will be redirected to said domain or
URL. For example:

- Entering `stallman.org` would redirect you to
  [stallman.org](https://stallman.org/).
- Entering `https://smile.amazon.com` would redirect you to
  [smile.amazon.com](https://smile.amazon.com/).

#### Query Paramater

Additionally, you can pass any query via the `q` query param. For example:

- Going to `file:///path/to/tilde/index.html?q=cats` would search
  [Google for cats](https://encrypted.google.com/search?q=cats).

This allows you to invoke Tilde with your native browser search bar.

### Configuration

The above is just the beginning. Open up the [index.html](index.html) file and
read through the `CONFIG`!
